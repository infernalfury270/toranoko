He goes to great lengths to ensure that his children are well-fed and his wife comes back from work to a clean home. While the people around him fear the glare from his sanpaku eyes, his children seek comfort in his gentle gaze. Even though his daughters struggle at school and his wife gets stressed from her role as a mother, he continues to work to his strengths, ensuring his meals put bright smiles on their faces.",

With her strong fighting spirit and charisma, she became a feisty and wealthy salarywoman to support her family of six, but being a mother has been an absolute nightmare. The fear of where her daughters will be in the future is constantly looming over her, and she feels totally powerless over them, especially with how much bigger they were compared to her. Well, as long as everyone comes home at the end of the day, they'll be fine, right?",

Well, she isn't that smart, since she's one of the lower performing students of the class. But she's always trying to help her sisters just barely pass their exams. She's also formed a weird antagonistic relationship with her English teacher, since she gets bugged by her the most. It's hard to blame her when she's just doing everything she can to fit in.",

She usually finds herself getting between her sisters, while her sisters are always trying to protect her from any threats that come her way. She really, really loves books, so much so that it disrupts her performance in class. While she hides from the scary world outside her books, her wish to share this love of books remains.",

Her strength helps her knock any obstacles out of her sisters' way. She's the most hostile of the sisters, so nobody dares to mess with her, besides a few outliers. She isn't afraid to get violent as long as it protects the secure triangle the sisters have formed. But at worst, you'll get put six feet under. The only one that can take her on is Haruko, who is always trying to get her study.",

Now in his second year of junior high, he goes about his life without a care in the world, only needing his video games and gamer friends to keep him company, or so he believes.",
