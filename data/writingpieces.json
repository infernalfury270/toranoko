However, her path would take a turn after Yuri, her English teacher, decides to randomly assign pairs for her English class. The sisters were terrible with group work, especially Haruko, who always took the snide remarks from her peers to heart. That's why, after getting paired with Sagawa Kaito, an irate, sleep-deprived, loner, she knew she had to steel her resolve. But a terrible incident would befall Kaito, one that Haruko felt partly responsible for. Through her guilt and regret, she tries her best to make it up to him, learning more about the boy as a result.","entries":[
