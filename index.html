                    <h2>What is "Toranoko!" about?</h2>
                    <p>Amongst the students of Ohashi High School is an oddity: a set of identical triplets, the Takasu sisters.
                        <br>Takasu Haruko, Mitsuko and Katsuko are the children of Taiga and Ryuuji, two high school sweethearts.
                        <br>After graduation and marriage, an event with odds of one-in-a-million would befall them: the birth of their children.
                        <br>Now, they've enrolled their daughters into the same school where they'd found each other.
                        <br><br>But their conception is not their only peculiarity. It only takes one look to see it; <b>they're freakishly big</b>.
                        <br>Their unusually tall height and outrageously large busts are enough to attract all eyes towards them.
                        <br>They're also <b>huge idiots</b>; the type to always be on the brink of failure. They're always causing trouble 
                        <br>for their teachers, especially their English teacher. But besides their looks and their lack of smarts, they're...
                        <br>Well, they're not very well-liked in their school either.
                        <br><br>With the nasty rumours spread around by other girls, and the invasive hands of boys they don't even know, 
                        <br>high school became a battlefield the moment they set foot on the premises. Their notoriety made them a 
                        <br>punching-bag for every student in that school. So what's the most logical response? To punch back, of course!
                        <br>With the inherited powers of the Palm-Top Tiger, the girls must navigate high school and do everything they can to survive.
                        <br><br>"Toranoko!" is separated into multiple storylines, each focusing on a different child of Taiga and Ryuuji,
                        <br>and the different people and challenges they come across.
