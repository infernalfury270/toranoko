                    <h2>What is "Toranoko!" about?</h2>
                    <p><b>Takasu Haruko, Mitsuko and Katsuko</b> were the precious treasures of Taiga and Ryuuji, 
born under the promise that their children would be raised with more love and care than they had been given themselves 
in the hopes that they would grow into wonderful people and be a happy family together. However, even with a lavish house 
and delicious meals everyday, the question of whether that would be enough to fulfil it had yet to be answered.
<br><br>
After learning that their school days were a far cry from the fluffy dreams their parents had fed them, 
the triplets found solace in each other's company. Academically, they were barely scraping by. Socially, they only struggled, 
unable to find peers they could connect with. It didn't help that their towering height and peculiar bodies made them 
stick out like a sore thumb. But as long as they had each other, they believed they could survive.
<br><br>
But is this sisterly trifecta truly the path towards a bright future for the girls? Perhaps it would leave 
them sheltered from the rest of the world, leaving a void that can only be filled with new, warm connections. As the sisters 
develop through their years at Ohashi High School and they start finding their footing in the world, they begin to learn 
whether blood really is thicker than water.
