                    <h2>What is "Toranoko!" about?</h2>
                    <p>Amongst the students of Ohashi High School is an oddity: a set of identical triplets, the Takasu sisters.
                        <br>Takasu Haruko, Mitsuko and Katsuko are the children of Taiga and Ryūji, two high school sweethearts.
                        <br>After graduation and marriage, an event with odds of one-in-a-million would befall them: the birth of their children.
                        <br>Now, they've enrolled their daughters into the same school where they'd found each other.
                        <br>But their conception is not their only peculiarity. It only takes one look to see it; <b>they're freakishly big</b>.
                        <br>Their unusually tall height and outrageously large busts are enough to attract all eyes towards them.
                        <br><br>Until the very first day of high school, the sisters have never kept a single friend, thanks to their 
                        <br>inability to fit in with their peers. Their social ineptitude and their outlandish appearances
                        <br>leads them to be subject to incessant bullying. Thus, with "fitting in with the class"
                        <br>out of the question, they're left with only one goal: to survive high school. The problem is that they're
                        <br><b>a bunch of idiots</b>, so much so that they've become sworn enemies every teacher that comes their way.
                        <br>Without grades or friends, the sisters can only wonder what kind of lives they'll be cursed to if 
                        <br>they don't find a way to fit into society.
                        <br><br>"Toranoko!" is separated into multiple storylines, each focusing on a different child of Taiga and Ryūji,
                        <br>and the people they will interact with.
